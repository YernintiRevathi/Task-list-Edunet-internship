# Interactive To-Do List Application

This is a feature-rich, front-end to-do list application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete (which moves them to the bottom of the list), reorder active tasks using drag-and-drop, and delete tasks.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add tasks to your list via an input field.
*   **Mark as Complete**: Check off tasks to mark them as done.
*   **Auto-Sorting**: Completed tasks are automatically moved to the bottom of the list to keep active tasks in focus.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Easily change the priority of your active tasks by dragging and dropping them into a new order.
*   **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
*   **Card-Based UI**: Each task is presented as a clean, modern card.
*   **Visual Drag Handle**: A clear visual indicator shows that tasks are draggable, improving user experience.
*   **Responsive & Scrollable**: The task list will become scrollable if it exceeds a certain height, keeping the layout clean.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the structure of the application.
*   **CSS3**: For all styling, including the card layout, animations, and the drag handle.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all the interactive logic, including task creation, DOM manipulation, and the drag-and-drop API.
*   **Unicons**: For the trash can icon.

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two easy ways to run this project locally.

### Method 1: Using VS Code Live Server (Recommended)

1.  Make sure you have the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension installed in VS Code.
2.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
3.  Right-click on the `index.html` file.
4.  Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
5.  Your default browser will open with the application running. The page will automatically reload whenever you save a file.

### Method 2: Opening the HTML File Directly

Since this project uses no backend or complex modules, you can also just open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. However, using a local server is better practice for web development.
